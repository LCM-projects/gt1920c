How to configure ethernet
Go to "Edit connections" in the network manager.
In "IPv4 Settings", change "Method" to "Manual".
Add address "192.168.80.99", this somehow set's the camera's IP to .100
In "Routes", check "Use this connection only for resources on its network".

How to setup PTP (time sync)
$ sudo apt-get install ptpd

Then in a terminal say:
$ sudo ptpd -i eno1 -W -t -C

eno1 is the ethernet interface that the camera is connected to. There is some
requirement on the ethernet adaptor, I don't know the details, but chances are
don't connect to the USB3 ones, try to use the ones on the motherboard.

This turns this computer into the ptpd master, the gt1920c driver will
configure all the cameras as slaves, which means that their reported timestamps
will be synced w.r.t this computer's clock.
